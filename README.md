# Florafy ðŸŒ±

Florafy is a Django web application that allows users to manage and care for virtual plants. Each plant grows over time, but requires attention from the user. Neglected plants may wilt or regress in growth. The app encourages daily interaction and gamifies plant care with growth stages, health tracking, and achievements.

## Features

1. **User Management**
   - Sign up, login, and logout.
   - Each user manages their own garden of plants.

2. **Plant CRUD**
   - Create, Read, Update, Delete plants.
   - Attributes:
     - Name
     - Species / Type (Cactus, Fern, Flower, etc.)
     - Growth Stage (Seedling â†’ Juvenile â†’ Mature â†’ Flowering)
     - Health (0â€“100)
     - Last cared for (timestamp)
     - Optional: water level, sunlight, nutrients

3. **Growth System**
   - Plants grow over time if properly cared for.
   - Requirements for growth:
     - Water
     - Sunlight
     - Fertilizer
   - Actions are recorded with timestamps.
   - Plants advance to next growth stage only if requirements are met.
   - Visual indicators for growth and health.

4. **Neglect System**
   - If a plant is not tended for 1 week:
     - Health decreases gradually.
     - Growth may stagnate or regress.
     - Plant may wilt (visual change).
   - Cron jobs / background tasks automatically update plant health and growth status daily.

5. **Dashboard**
   - Userâ€™s garden overview showing all plants.
   - Highlights plants that need attention.
   - Displays health, growth stage, and care history.

6. **Gamification**
   - Achievements for reaching full growth.
   - Badges for streaks of consistent care.
   - Optional leveling system for plants.

7. **Accessories (Optional)**
   - Users can attach accessories to plants (pots, decorations, fertilizers).
   - Accessories have optional effects (bonus health or growth speed).

## Models and ERD
Florafy has the following main models:

1. **User** (built-in Django auth user)  
   - Fields: username, email, password, etc.  
   - Relationship: One-to-Many with Plant

2. **Plant**  
   - Fields: name, species, planting_date, description, growth_stage  
   - Relationships:  
     - Many-to-One: User â†’ Plant  
     - Many-to-Many: Plant â†” Accessory  
     - One-to-Many: Plant â†’ CareAction

3. **Accessory**  
   - Fields: name, type, description
   - Relationships: Many-to-Many with Plant

4. **CareAction**
   - Fields: date, action_type (watering, fertilizing, pruning), notes  
   - Relationships: Many-to-One with Plant

- **Relationships**
  - `User` â†’ `Plant` : One-to-Many (a user can have many plants)
  - `Plant` â†’ `Accessory` : Many-to-Many (plants can have multiple accessories)
  - `Plant` â†’ `CareAction` : One-to-Many (each care action is recorded)
